# StatisticsAnalysis_EconomicalMobility
In this project, I will look at economic mobility across generations in the contemporary USA. The data come from a large study1, based on tax records, which allowed researchers to link the income of adults to the income of the irparents several decades previously. For privacy reasons, I donâ€™t have that individual-level data, but I do have aggregate statistics about economic mobility for several hundred communities, containing most of the American population, and covariate information about those communities. I am interested in predicting economic mobility from the characteristics of communities.
